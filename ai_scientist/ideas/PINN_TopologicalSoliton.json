        "Short Hypothesis": "Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) can learn both the static kink profiles and dynamical interactions of topological solitons in the one-dimensional ϕ⁴ field theory with accuracy comparable to spectral solvers, while offering speed-ups in inference.",

        "Abstract": "We propose to develop and benchmark physics-informed neural networks for modeling topological solitons in the one-dimensional ϕ⁴ scalar field theory. First, we train PINNs to recover the analytic static kink solution under fixed boundary conditions and topological charge constraints. Next, we extend the framework to dynamical evolution: networks learn time-dependent soliton trajectories, collisions, and radiation effects. We compare performance—accuracy, stability, and runtime—against pseudospectral and finite-difference solvers. Finally, we explore architecture variants (fully connected, convolutional, and equivariant networks) and assess generalization to perturbed initial conditions and multi-soliton configurations.",

        ],
        "Risk Factors and Limitations": "Training PINNs on highly nonlinear, topologically nontrivial solutions can suffer from optimization difficulties and poor convergence. The networks may struggle to encode exact topological charge conservation, leading to drift over long time horizons. Capturing fine radiation during soliton collisions requires high resolution, which may negate speed-up advantages. Black-box models limit interpretability and rigorous error estimates; overfitting to specific initial conditions can impair generalization to new regimes."
