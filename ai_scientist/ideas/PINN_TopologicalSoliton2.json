        "Abstract": "We propose to develop and benchmark physics-informed neural networks for modeling topological solitons in the one-dimensional phi4 scalar field theory. First, we train PINNs to recover the analytic static kink solution by just training PINN with the fixed boundary conditions and the equation of motion. Then, we compare the resultant solution with the analytic solution, and see the recovery. Finally, we compare various architectures and methods of training, and compare the performance of PINN against other non-NN methods such as finite-difference solvers.",

        ],
        "Risk Factors and Limitations": "Training PINNs on highly nonlinear, topologically nontrivial solutions can suffer from optimization difficulties and poor convergence. The soliton location is a zero mode and various solutions are obtained, so the comparison with the exact analytic solution needs to be done up to the change of the soliton location. The networks may struggle to encode exact topological charge conservation, leading to drift over long time horizons. Black-box models limit interpretability and rigorous error estimates; overfitting to specific initial conditions can impair generalization to new regimes."
